            <p>ðŸ’° The controversy surrounding the ownership of Disco Elysium highlights the importance of contracts and legal agreements in creative industries.</p>
            <p>ðŸŽ² Disco Elysium was originally a tabletop RPG created by Robert Kurvitz and his friends in Estonia.</p>
            <p>ðŸŽ® The team behind Disco Elysium had no game development experience and worked for years in a derelict building, yet still managed to create an amazing game that fulfilled their original vision.</p>
            <p>ðŸ¤¯ The story of how Disco Elysium was stolen from its creators involves "a lot of fraud and greed."</p>
            <p>ðŸ’° The scheme used to obtain ownership of Disco Elysium without spending a penny was corrupt and complex, involving taking money from ZA/UM to buy ZA/UM.</p>
            <p>ðŸ’° The new owners of ZA/UM demoted the original owners and ousted them from the company in order to have full control and sell it to larger publishers, showing a lack of concern for the longevity of the studio.</p>
            <p>ðŸ’° The original creators of Disco Elysium are still fighting for wrongful dismissal and claiming that majority ownership of ZA/UM was acquired through fraud, despite the money being repaid to the studio.</p>
